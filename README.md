# Game-project-1

I am going to create a pong game. I chose pong because it was one of the first games ever and one of the first games I played.

To start I need to create the basic elements of the game
-Html skeleton
    'backgound color
    'h1 tag at top for Pong title
    'Start button at center
    'center divider
    'h2 tags on left and right of screen for points


-Countdown for when game starts
    'After clicking start timer counts down from 3 at the center


-AI for enemy maybe


-Bumpers
    'Bumpers move with w,s keys or up and down arrow keys(maybe both to make it 2 player)



-Ball
    'I have to make the ball move at a random path at the begining
    'The ball will the have to bounce off the walls with the correct angle
    'Then the ball will have to bounce of the bumpers possibly even in a specific direction depending on where it lands
        ex(if it hit the top end of the bumper it would bounce toward the top part of the screen)


-Point tracker
    'Points will go up win ball hits opponents side
    'Set Point limit


-Winner
    'Message pops up after player reaches point limit saying winner P1 or P2 is the winner
